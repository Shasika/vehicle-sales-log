### 💰 Understanding Profit Calculations

**The Formula:**
```
🧮 Gross Profit = Sale Price - Purchase Price - Total Expenses
📊 Profit Margin = (Gross Profit ÷ Sale Price) × 100
```

**What's Included in Expenses:**
- Repair and maintenance costs
- Transport and delivery fees
- Registration and paperwork fees
- Any other vehicle-related expenses

**Example Calculation:**
```
🚗 Vehicle: Toyota Camry (ABC-123)
💵 Purchase Price: $15,000
🔧 Repair Costs: $1,200
🚚 Transport: $300
💰 Sale Price: $18,500

📊 Calculation:
   Gross Profit = $18,500 - $15,000 - $1,500 = $2,000
   Profit Margin = ($2,000 ÷ $18,500) × 100 = 10.8%
```
