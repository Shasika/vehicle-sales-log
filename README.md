## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- MongoDB (local or cloud)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vehicle-sales-log-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` with your configuration:
   ```env
   # Database
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/vehicle-sales-log
   
   # NextAuth (generate a secure secret)
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-here-minimum-32-characters
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   
   # File Uploads
   UPLOAD_DIR=./public/uploads
   MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760
   
   # Other settings...
   ```

4. **Start MongoDB**
   ```bash
   # If using local MongoDB
   mongod
   
   # Or use MongoDB Atlas cloud service
   ```

5. **Seed the database** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```
   
   This creates demo data with the following login credentials:
   - **Admin**: admin@example.com / password123
   - **Manager**: manager@example.com / password123  
   - **Clerk**: clerk@example.com / password123

6. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Open your browser**
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## File Upload Configuration

This application uses **local file storage only** for documents and images. Files are stored in the `/public/uploads` directory with the following structure:

```
public/uploads/
â”œâ”€â”€ vehicles/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2024/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 02/
â”œâ”€â”€ persons/
â”œâ”€â”€ deals/
â””â”€â”€ expenses/
```

### Upload Features
- Automatic thumbnail generation for images

### Key Design Patterns

#### Contextual Actions
The app uses contextual UI patterns instead of explicit buy/sell toggles:
- **NotOwned vehicles**: Show "Record Acquisition" button
- **InStock vehicles**: Show "Record Sale" button
- Global quick actions provide large tiles for "We acquired" vs "We sold"

#### Profit Calculation
Vehicle profit is calculated using complete cycles:
1. **Acquisition** (IN transaction) starts a cycle
2. **Expenses** between IN and OUT dates are included
3. **Sale** (OUT transaction) completes the cycle
4. **Profit** = Sale Price - Acquisition Cost - Cycle Expenses

#### File Management
Local file storage with security:
- Files organized by entity type and date
- Thumbnail generation for images
- Protected serving through API routes
- Automatic cleanup of orphaned files

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test
```
Tests cover core business logic, especially profit calculations and data validation.

### E2E Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```
Playwright tests verify critical user journeys across different browsers.

### Test Structure
```

â”œâ”€â”€ unit/                  # Jest unit tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lib/               # Business logic tests
â””â”€â”€ e2e/                   # Playwright E2E tests
    â”œâ”€â”€ auth.spec.ts       # Authentication flows
    â”œâ”€â”€ vehicles.spec.ts   # Vehicle management
    â””â”€â”€ transactions.spec.ts # Transaction recording
```

## Deployment

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in production:
```env
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=<production-mongodb-url>
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<secure-random-string>
NEXTAUTH_URL=<production-domain>
```

### Build Steps
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### File Storage Setup
1. Ensure `/public/uploads` directory exists with write permissions
2. Set up regular backups of the uploads directory
3. Configure log rotation for application logs
4. Set up monitoring for disk space usage

### Performance Considerations
- MongoDB indexes are optimized for common queries
- Images are automatically compressed and thumbnailed
- API responses use pagination for large datasets
- Client-side caching with SWR reduces server load
